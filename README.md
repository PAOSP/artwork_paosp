PornAOSP a combination of Material color palette and PornHub official palette. It basically stands of seven colors:

* White: #ffffff (you should know how white looks like kek)
* Black: <span style="color: #000000">#000000</span> (did you really expect anything else?)
* Amber: <span style="color: #ffa000">#ffa000</span>
* Dark Amber: <span style="color: ##ff6f00">#ff6f00</span>
* PornHub Amber: <span style="color: #f8981e">#f8981e</span>
* Grey: <span style="#050505">#050505</span>
* PornHub Grey: <span style="#141415">#141415</span>

Dark Amber is usually used for links, Amber and PornHub Amber for accents. Grey and PornHub Grey are meant to be used for background.

The system palette may differ from the upper one, but it's going to be merged.
